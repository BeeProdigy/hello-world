# hello-world
Just another repository my dudes.
I really enjoy mythology. Like, a little too much if I'm being honest. I have 3-8 mythology thesaurus... thesauri?
One of them is all about celtic lore because celtic lore is possibly the best (way better than Norse, which is already a superior field).
